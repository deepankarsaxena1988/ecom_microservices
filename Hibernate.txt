Bidirectional relationships must follow these rules:

The inverse side must refer to its owning sideby using the mappedBy attribute
The owning side may have the inversedBy attribute
@ManyToOne is always the owning side of a bidirectional association
@OneToMany is always the inverse side of a bidirectional association
the owning side of a @OneToOne association is the entity with the table containing the foreign key
The many side of many-to-one bidirectional relationships must not define the mappedBy attribute
For many-to-many bidirectional relationships, either side may be the owning side
